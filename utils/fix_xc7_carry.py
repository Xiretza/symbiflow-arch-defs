""" Script for addressing CARRY4 output congestion in elaborated netlists.

Usage:

    python3 fix_carry.py < input-netlist-json > output-netlist-json

Description:

    In the 7-series SLICEL (and SLICEM) sites, there can be output congestion
    if both the CO and O of the CARRY4 are used. This congestion can be
    avoided by using a transparent/open latch or register on the output of the
    CARRY4.

    VPR does not currently support either of those options, so for now, if
    both CO and O are used, the CO output is converted into a LUT equation to
    recompute the CO output from O, DI and S.  See carry_map.v and
    clean_carry_map.v for details.

    If VPR could emit the transparent/open latch on output congestion, this
    would no longer be required.  The major problem with transparent latch
    support is that it requires constants to be routed to the G/GE/CLR/PRE
    ports, which VPR cannot express as a result of packing.

    This script identifies CARRY4 chains in the netlist, identifies if there
    is output congestion on the O and CO ports, and marks the congestion by
    changing CARRY_CO_DIRECT (e.g. directly use the CO port) to CARRY_CO_LUT
    (compute the CO value using a LUT equation).

This diagram shows that if both the O and CO outputs are needed, once must
pass through the flip flop (xFF in the diagram).

Each CARRY4 spans the 4 rows of the SLICEL/SLICEM.
Row 0 is the S0/DI0/O0/CO0 ports, row 1 is S1/DI1/O1/CO1 ports, etc.

So there are five cases the script has to handle:

 - No congestion is present between O and CO ->

    Do nothing.

 - Congestion is present on rows 0-2 and row above is in use ->

    Change CARRY_CO_DIRECT to CARRY_CO_LUT.

    Routing and LUT delays are incurred in this case.

 - Congestion is present on rows 0-2 and row above is not in use ->

    Remap CO to O from the row above, and set S on the next row to 0 to
    ensure O outputs CI from the row below.

    No additional delays for this change.

 - Congestion is present on row 3 and CO3 is not connected to another CARRY ->

    Change CARRY_CO_DIRECT to CARRY_CO_TOP_POP.  This adds 1 dummy layer to
    the carry chain to output the CO.

    No additional delays for this change.

 - Congestion is present on row 3 and CO3 is connected directly to another
   CARRY4 ->

    Change CARRY_CO_DIRECT to CARRY_CO_LUT *and* change the chained
    CARRY_COUT_PLUG to be directly connected to the previous CO3.

    Routing and LUT delays are incurred in this case.
